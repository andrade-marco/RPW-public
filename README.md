# Role Playing Words (RPW)

This is the codebase for the RPW app, which can be accessed at https://rpw.herokuapp.com

Description:

Let your imagination and writing skills take over. In RPW, stories are not just written, they are built. Working together, writers can build stories by creating new storylines and contributing to each other stories. The community then votes on whether or not proposed contributions should become part of the main storylines. Better writing increases the chances of your contributions being accepted and improve your reputation, giving you more privileges within the community.
